# RedditRipper
A simple python script for ripping in a .txt file every entry in a subreddit. It runs on Python 3.

# Setup:
1- Must install "praw".

2- You need to edit line 14 with your own app details created from here https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/. Make it a script, and just stick any URL in the about and redirect fields.

When it asks for a start date, you can get the subreddits birthday by hovering over the "9 years" bit where it says "a community for 9 years" in the sidebar.
